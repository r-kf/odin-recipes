    <h2>Chocolate Cake</h2>
    <p>Rich in chocolate flavour with a tender-moist crumb, and fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness. This is what chocolate dreams are made of!</p>

    <h2>You will need...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking spray with flour</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 cup hot brewed coffee</li>
        <li>3/4 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>Chocolate-Cream Cheese frosting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine chocolate chips and hot coffee in a medium bowl; let stand 2 minutes. Stir until chocolate is melted, about 1 minute. Whisk in oil, sour cream, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in wet ingredients. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans (about 2 cups per pan).</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in pans 10 minutes. Invert cake layers onto wire racks, and let cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting between layers and on top of cake. Spread a thin layer of frosting on sides of cake, smoothing with a spatula. Chill cake 30 minutes. Spread an additional layer of frosting on top and sides of cake.</li>
    </ol>
